as dark as night
as night
as equal or comparable with me
as splendid by reason of this present insult
as Minerva bade him
as Caeneus
as it was in me to do
like honour with Agamemnon
as captain
as his dear comrade had bidden him
as a messenger from Jove
as yet laid a hand upon his ship
like children or widowed women
like children
like men
like great flocks of geese
as leaves that bloom in summer
like Mars
like that of Neptune
as is enclosed between Hyrmine
as was also golden-haired Meleager
like oil
as fleet as birds
as birds
as Mars in battle
as Achilles' anger lasted
like a consuming fire
as in time of peace
as of a great multitude
like a girl
as well it may be
as it were some great woolly ram ordering his ewes
like a god
as shall be agreed upon
as this wine
as a sign to mariners or to some great army
as it was bounding from a rock
as an ornament of which both horse and driver may be proud- even so
as our champion
as a by-word
like frightened fawns who
as dazed and spiritless as deer
as a wild boar
like my own
as to avoid confusion
like him
as an enemy but as a guest
as a guest
like honour with us
as of a great multitude- death-cry and shout of triumph of slain and slayers
like wolves
as a poplar that has grown straight and tall in a meadow by some mere
like a winter torrent that has burst its barrier in full flood
as yet unwearied
as men now are it would take two to lift it
as high honour as Hector himself
as Hector himself
like brave men
as yet warded off destruction from him
as to let him walk uprightly
as with a fringe
like that of brazen-voiced Stentor
as Achilles was fighting
as it would
as we can
as we do this man: his rage is beyond all bounds
as an offering to Minerva: it glittered like a star
like a star
as from a desire to indulge my grief
as a star
like a coward
as myself
as fast as his feet could take him
like manner
as Hector son of Priam
as with a garment
as a mark of special honour
as far as dawn itself
as dawn itself
as far as dawn itself
as of a great multitude
like a coward
as with a garment
as a goddess
like those of Gorgo or murderous Mars
as luck will have it
as it may
as sure of being immortal and never growing old
like Minerva and Apollo
as is my right in council
as many prizes as my horses have won me
as my horses have won me
like honour with my own dear son Orestes
as no man ever yet gave his daughter
as his comrade bade him
like a maniac
like honour with his own dear son Orestes
as no man ever yet gave his daughter
as though were a god
as a god
like measure to him who works and him who is idle
as Venus
as Minerva
as in duty bound
as a mere lad from Phthia to Agamemnon
as daughters to great Jove
as all good men will bow
as even a wise man will sometimes be
as a god
like honour
like honour with myself
as it is
as though it would leap out of my body
as a guest-gift to Molus
as fast as his legs could take him
as his legs could take him
as a spy or as an open enemy
as an open enemy
as a sign to Diomed
as a spy upon our ships
as a guest-gift
as a sign to mortal men
like an immortal
as a god
like wolves
like a lion
as envoys
as though it were a ball
like by horsemen
as though it had been lead: King Agamemnon caught it from his hand
as it were of bronze
as a huntsman hounds his dogs on against a lion or wild boar
as goats fear a lion
as loudly as man can cry
as man can cry
as his blood was warm and his strength has lasted
like a wall
as some lazy ass that has had many a cudgel broken about his back
as to give him cover
as it were a flaming fire
as his dear comrade had bidden him
as fair as a goddess
as a goddess
as many wide-spreading flocks of goats
like a whirlwind
as surely as ever was
as ever was
as guests expect
as Hector lived and Achilles nursed his anger
as a defence against all who would assail it
as third in command
like slim-waisted wasps
as it were a fiery furnace
as though it were not well
as regards our place at table
as though we were gods
as it were a thick dark cloud
as men now are
as dark as that of flying night
as that of flying night
like fire
as a glance towards Troy
like a storm-cloud or flame of fire
like a pillar of flame
like panic-stricken hinds
as a wall against me
as though it had been a ball
like a flame of fire
as to do honour to fleet Achilles
as an oak
as one man stood near him
as fierce as ever
like a vulture
like a charred stake in Antilochus’s shield
as it rolled at his feet
as it were a flaming fire
as a wall of fire
as with a circle of fire
like a snowy mountain
like honour with Minerva and Apollo
like Achilles
as we needs must
like lightning
like a top and reel in all directions
as well as ourselves
as with a diadem
as on a level with myself
as on a level with himself
as Jove may be
like honour with himself
as Jove would have me
like empire with himself
as a horse
as fast as his limbs could take him
as his limbs could take him
as to make a great broad bridge
as much as our own parents
as our own parents
as one of his own sons
as a dog springs on a fawn which a hunter has hit as it was breaking away from its covert
as it was breaking away from its covert
like some savage creature which knows it has done wrong
as lions
as that of Mars
as a tower foursquare
like flames of fire from every quarter
as a dun eagle swoops down upon a flock of wild- fowl feeding near a river-geese
as also Peleus son of Aeacus
as his wedded wife
as Erylaus was on to attack him
as it lay
like a valiant soldier
as having much people with him
as swiftly as a hawk that swoops down on a flock of daws or starlings
as a hawk that swoops down on a flock of daws or starlings
as Bathycles who was pursuing him was about to lay hold of him
like myself
as large as his hand could hold
as his hand could hold
as it were
as one dazed
as to drive it home
like a flame of fire
like some bearded lion who is being chased by dogs and men from a stockyard with spears and hue and cry
as a man of more understanding than any in all Lycia
as Jove vouchsafes him power and glory
as it were a flaming fire
as a lion that has been gorging upon a bull
as a raging fire and deals his blows without ceasing
as bold as a fly
as a fly
as a soldier
as keenly as an eagle
as an eagle
as Menelaus had said
as in name
like wildfire over a city
as it were a flaming fire
as messenger
as a sapling
as a plant in a goodly garden
as dearly as my own life
as my own life
like smoke
like doom awaits me
as with a garment
like measure to all
as a sapling
as befitting gods
as a thought of danger
as we may we must let this man lie
as no living could have fashioned
as Venus
like some falcon sailing on his broad wings and screaming
like fire
as though it had been wings
like Mars himself
as some black thunder-cloud
as his guardian angel
as though we were children
as a man says
as of death and with his keen blade drawn
as men now are
as fire- though his hands be fire and his strength iron
like a flame of fire
as a god can
like a god
like dazed fawns
as much to gain my freedom
as may escape
as also many corpses
as with a blare of trumpets
as a lion among women
as our people are inside and in safety
as one possessed
like fawns
as captives
as it were Mars himself
as fast as his limbs could take him
as his limbs could take him
as smoke from a burning fire
as hail or snow
as did all my comrades
as myself- Peleus
as a god
as though it would come into my mouth and my limbs refuse to carry me
like a maniac
as yet a mere infant
like himself
as is reasonable
as yet unsoiled by smoke
as a doubling-post in days gone by
as umpire
as it were a cloud or whirlwind
as if about to mount Eumelus’s chariot
as our custom is
as victor
as also mighty Diomed son of Tydeus
like honour to Hector and to Achilles
as may give him satisfaction
as a messenger from Jove
as shall give satisfaction to Achilles
as a messenger from Jove
as shall give satisfaction to Achilles
as shall give satisfaction to Achilles
as a bird of ill omen in my house
as a goodly present to Priam
as one dazed
as a god to see
as golden Venus standing on Pergamus
as one whom Apollo has slain with his painless shafts
